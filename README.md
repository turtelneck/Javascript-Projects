Tic Tac Toe:
<ul>
	<li>It's the classic Tic Tac Toe game that programming students make! Very, <i>very</i> exciting. On the bright side, the computer only makes choices at random, so if you like winning you're in the right place.</li>
</ul>
Slideshow/Timer:
<ul>
	<li>I'm happy with how this one came out. The slideshow looks nice, and I also ensured that the timer doesn't count down infinitely.</li>
</ul>
To-Do List:
<ul>
	<li>This is a web app that makes a simple list you can add and delete items from.</li>
</ul>
React Projects:

	<li>These aren't particularly complicated, but are a demonstration of simple uses for React.</li>
</ul>
Ajax Demo:
<ul>
	<li>Again, not complicated, just a demo of Ajax implementation.</li>
</ul>
